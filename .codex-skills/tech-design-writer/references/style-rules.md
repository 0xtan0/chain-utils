# Canonical Style Rules (ERC20-Based)

Canonical source:
`/Users/federicocavazzoli/Documents/wonder/chain-utils/.designs/erc20/TECH_DESIGN.md`

When available, mirror these conventions:

1. Start with a title and status/scope/stack block.
2. Include a numbered table of contents.
3. Use numbered sections and subsections (`## 1.`, `### 1.1`).
4. Separate goals and non-goals explicitly.
5. Use tables for package or module structure when relevant.
6. Describe interfaces and type contracts directly.
7. Include a public API section listing exported surface.
8. Include design considerations and tradeoff rationale near the end.
9. Use Mermaid only when charts are needed.

Content boundaries:

- Prefer high-level architecture and contract definition.
- Include concise code examples only when needed for clarity.
- Never include full implementations.
- Never include test sections or test cases.
- Never cite unverified sources.

Quality posture:

- Prioritize SOLID-aligned decomposition.
- Enforce secure-by-design principles across interfaces and data flow.
